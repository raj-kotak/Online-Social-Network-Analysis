1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

Answer:-
This approach is misleading because if you check the friends count for Jill Stein 
and Gary Johnson are 1648 and 3481 respectively, whereas the friends count for 
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are 748 and 42 people respectively. 
We can analyse and conclude that, as Jill Stein and Gary Johnson have 
more friends count, their overlap count will be more. This does not 
conclude that they are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

One easy way to fix this is to use Jaccard Index which is one of the statistics used 
to compare the similarity and diversity of sample sets.
	J(A, B) = |A Intersection B| / |A U B|
		= |A U B| / |A| + |B| - |A Intersection B|
 
Another way is to calculate percentage of the common friends between all the 4 candidates.
Then, subract the percentages of (Jill Stein and Gary Johnson) and that of (Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump)
Thus we get the similarities between by comparing these two differences. Lesser the differences more similar
they are.
Calculations:
Common friends between Jill Stein and Gary Johnson: 238
DrJillStein: (238/1648)*100 = 14.44%
GivGaryJohnson: (238/3481)*100 = 6.83%

Common friends between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: 1
HillaryClinton: (1/762)*100 = 0.13%
realDonaldTrump: (1/45)*100 = 2.22%

Now, differences:
A = 14.44 - 6.83
  = 7.61
B = 2.22 - 0.13
  = 2.09

Therefore, from above we notice that A is greater than B, i.e., Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are more 
similar than Jill Stein and Gary Johnson.


2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.


Answer:-
From the output we conclude that the common user who is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump is Whitehouse.
We know that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were the candidates for the Presidential Election 2016. 
Also, we know that Whitehouse is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States.
Therefore, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have followed the user Whitehouse.



3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Answer:- 
Donald Trump is an American business man and also the Republican Party candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 election.
Gary Earl Johnson is also an American businessman, author and the Libertarian Party candidate for the Presidential elections 2016.
Donald Trump is more of a famous personality than Gary Johnson, so Donald Trump does not need to follow more people as he already has a 
well established profile. While Gary Johnson, who is not as famous as Donald Trump, has to follow more people as he does not have a more 
established profile.
This surely affects our analysis as we are analysing how often each friend is followed and also how many shared accounts with respect to 
other candidates. As Gary Johnson follows more people, there will be more common friends between them and hence will return more 
overlapping friends with respect to other candidates. Similarly for Donald Trump, as he follows quite less people, there will be less 
common friends and therefore will return quite less overlapping friends with respect to other candidates.


4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Answer:-
Count of friends for each candidate:
DrJillStein 4159
GovGaryJohnson 3124
HillaryClinton 748
realDonaldTrump 42

So to get the total requests for accounts followed by each of the friends of candidates, we add all the friends count
which gives us the total requests:
	Total requests = 1648 + 3481 + 762 + 45
	       	       = 5936 requests

Considering rate limit for the requests (GET requests: 15 calls every 15 minutes):
	Minutes required = Approximately (5936 Minutes + Execution time)
	to collect this 
	data
